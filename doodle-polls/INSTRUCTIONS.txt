For building appropriate images and running containers please follow these steps:

In project root directory run these instructions: Filipove instrukcije :

1* mvn clean install
2* docker-compose build
3* docker-compose up

Application will be started and you can check that hitting URL: http://localhost:8080/api/polls

(I have problems with sending jar files to GitHub and just because of that first instruction is also needed, to generate .JAR file in target file)
